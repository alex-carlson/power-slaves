stryg: i believe this concludes your objective, [NAME]. as we promised, we will transport you back with us to dakdeilex and provide you with the finest lodgings and nourishment we can offer you.
stryg: there is enough data to suggest that the conditions on our planet are actually quite close to yours, so i hope you will find it adequate to your humanly needs.
[NAME]: wow, i didn`t know earth was full of all this cool stuff... humans back then had it so good, why`d we let the place rot like this?
stryg: hmm, well, my studies of human technological history indicate that it is highly probable that there was very little you could have done to prevent earth`s inevitable demise.
stryg: yet, while this dismal epoch has not been kind to your planet, it is quite astonishing, statistically speaking, that humans have evaded extinction for this long.
[NAME]: i know people used to make up some wild stories about the end times, but here we are living it out for real.
[NAME]: we`re scared, dude, but we love happy endings. that`s why all those stories are so good to listen to.
[NAME]: humans love having hope and stuff. we wanna believe that if we just try hard enough, we`ll pull through, and after the bad times come the good ones.
[NAME]: now that the sun`s about to swallow us whole, there`s no future to live for, so we`re counting down the days until we all go off into the great beyond and hope that maybe it`s gonna be better than this dump.
[NAME]: looking back, i guess we had a good run. so this is it, huh...
stryg: is there anyone you would like to bid farewell before we leave, [NAME]?
[NAME]: nah, that`s alright, i don`t want to keep you guys waiting any longer. your families probably miss you a whole lot more than anyone here`s gonna miss me.
[NAME]: and i sure as hell don`t have anyone here worth saying goodbye to, so let`s mosey on up to your crib.
stryg: very well then, commencing takeoff in 3... 2... 1...
