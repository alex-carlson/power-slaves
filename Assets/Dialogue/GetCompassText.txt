[NAME]: This must be some ancient relic from a creature long extinct.
[NAME]: I can feel energy radiating from it.
:HOME:
stryg: welcome back, [name]. Have you come to deliver an item to us?
[GOTCOMPASS]
stryg: this is... the compass? what an interesting device...
[NAME]: how the hell does it even work?
stryg: according to our preliminary research, this needle serves to align itself with the earth`s north magnetic pole.
stryg: although, it appears to be malfunctioning... in the eons since it was made, the poles seem to have shifted, so it is not of much use in the present day.
stryg: but to imagine human navigators using nothing but compasses and sextants to guide their vessels to their destinations, looking to the stars for direction...
stryg: it is almost... romantic, in a way. do you not agree?
[NAME]: i mean, sorta. most of us don`t really care where we`re going, because it`s all the same everywhere you go. 
[NAME]: nothing but sand and rocks and gangs fighting over what patch of sand and rocks belongs to who.
[NAME]: there are a whole lot more places you don`t want to end up in than there are places you do want to go.
stryg: it seems human nature has not changed perhaps as much as you would think, [NAME].
[NAME]: maybe not, dude. otherwise we might have been able to figure out a way to save ourselves. i guess we`ll never know at this point.
stryg: you still have [ITEMCOUNT] more items left to retrieve:
Stryg: do feel free to rest here for a moment and regain your strength before resuming your mission.
Stryg: we are counting on you, [NAME]. you have our utmost faith in your capabilites. good luck.
